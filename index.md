:computer: I contributed a lot to [Cyfra](https://github.com/ComputeNode/cyfra/), [Futurecoder](https://futurecoder.io) and [OSSU CS](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/), so check them out!

:brain: Check out my [Elements of Abstract Thinking](https://github.com/spamegg1/abstract-thinking)

💬 Ask me about: math or code questions!

📫 How to reach me: `spamegg1` on Discord, or [on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/spamegg/shared_invite/zt-1vhzofzrl-ucBjeQEQkl9Ol3wpvL9VPw), or [on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!GQFJgtvxFByBVixTAi:matrix.org?via=matrix.org)

⚡ Fun fact: I [review](https://github.com/spamegg1/reviews) online courses.

🔭 I’m currently working on: my own combined Math + CS curriculum, focusing on deep connections and foundations, ideas, history, abstract thinking and problem solving.

🌱 I’m currently learning: some [GPU programming](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-vi-gpu-computing/chapter-39-parallel-prefix-sum-scan-cuda)
and [coding logic](https://github.com/gapt/gapt)

🤔 I’m looking for: nothing at the moment! Still feel free to shoot any ideas my way!
