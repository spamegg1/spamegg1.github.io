‚ö° Fun fact: I [review](https://github.com/spamegg1/reviews) online courses.

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on: my own combined Math + CS curriculum, focusing on deep connections and foundations, ideas, history, abstract thinking and problem solving.

üå± I‚Äôm currently learning: some [GPU programming](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-vi-gpu-computing/chapter-39-parallel-prefix-sum-scan-cuda)

ü§î I‚Äôm looking for: nothing at the moment! Still feel free to shoot any ideas my way!
