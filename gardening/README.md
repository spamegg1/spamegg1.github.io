# Gardening

## Childhood in ruins

In 2024-25, I rescued my now abandoned childhood home from garbage, debris,
and overgrown ivy roots. It was in very bad shape:

- The hole you see there was actually my bedroom! Along with rats and scorpion friends.

## Then good things happened

- Potato plants, still early and small:

- Digging the ground, clearing very deep and annoying roots. Ridiculously hard work!

- First potato flowers blossomed, how beautiful!

- Garden overall; all of this was covered in garbage, debris, roots and ivy.

- There are dozens of stray cats everywhere, they keep digging and crapping in my garden.
  So I have to protect my plants.
